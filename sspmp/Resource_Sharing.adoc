[[PMP_Resource_Sharing]]
== Extension of Resource Sharing

Given that PMP and SPMP have similar layout of address/config registers and the same address matching logic.
Reusing registers and comparators between PMP and SPMP may be benefitial (in some cases) to save hardware resources.
This section introduces the resource sharing extension that can support dynamic reallocation of hardware resource between PMP/ePMP and SPMP.
Notably, **this extension is not mandatory** and a specific implementation can still statically implement the numbers of regions in PMP/ePMP and SPMP.

Implementations can consider PMP/SPMP entries as a resource pool (called PMP Resource).
Specifically, one entry of PMP Resource consists the address CSR, configuration CSR, and any micro-architecture states related to an PMP/SPMP entry.
A new M-mode CSR called `mpmpimppart` is introduced to control the sharing of PMP Resource between PMP and SPMP.

The 16-bit CSR shown in <<mpmpimppart_format>> has two fields:

. `pmpimp`: 7-bit, allowing a value of 0--64 to specify the number of PMP entries
. `spmpimp`: 7-bit, allowing a value of 0--64 to specify the number of SPMP entries

The above two fields allow each of the PMP and SPMP to be of different entries, giving extra flexibility.

**Constraints:**

. The values of `pmpimp` and `spmpimp` in `mpmpimppart`, under RV32, can only be a multiple of 4; under RV64, it can only be a multiple of 8. This design avoids sharing the same configuration CSR between S-mode and M-mode.
. The values of `pmpimp` and `spmpimp` in `mpmpimppart` cannot be larger than 64 (the maximum number of supported PMP/SPMP entries).
. The sum of `pmpimp` and `spmpimp` cannot be larger than the total number of PMP Resources.
. Not all physical address bits may be implemented, so the `mpmpimppart` is WARL. This can be utilized for feature discovery.

**Addressing:**

Notably, the mapping between PMP Resources and PMP/SPMP entries is defined by the specific implementation.
PMP entries will be supported contiguously, beginning with the lowest CSR number.
Unlike PMP, SPMP entries **may not** start at the lowest CSR number and might include non-contiguous valid entries.
For instance, given an implementation with a total of 64 PMP Resource entries, if both `pmpimp` and `spmpimp` are set to 32 during runtime,
`PMPResource[0]` to `PMPResource[31]` would map to `PMP[0]` to `PMP[31]`.
The remaining entries, `PMPResource[32]` to `PMPResource[63]`, could be mapped as either `SPMP[0]` to `SPMP[31]` or `SPMP[32]` to `SPMP[63]`, illustrating the flexibility in resource sharing design and implementation.
If the SPMP entry with lowest CSR number is configured with TOR address-matching mode, zero is used for the lower bound.

Another example is that, an implementation with a total of 96 PMP Resource entries,
if `pmpimp` is set to 48 and
`spmpimp` is set to 48 during runtime,
`PMPResource[0]` to `PMPResource[47]` would map to `PMP[0]` to `PMP[47]`.
`PMPResource[48]` to `PMPResource[63]` may map to `SPMP[48]` to `SPMP[63]`,
and `PMPResource[64]` to `PMPResource[95]` may map to `SPMP[0]` to `SPMP[31]`.
`SPMP[32]` to `SPMP[47]` are not implemented (from software perspective) in this case.  

**Re-configuration:**

M-mode software can re-configure the entries for PMP and SPMP by modifying the `mpmpimppart` CSR.
A re-configuration will be ignored if it will change the PMP resource of a locked PMP entry to an SPMP entry.

[NOTE]
====
Different mapping implementations have their own trade-offs.
For example, mapping `PMPResource[32]` to `PMPResource[63]` onto `SPMP[0]` to `SPMP[31]` could necessitate additional hardware resources to translate the SPMP CSR index to the corresponding `PMPResource`.
This might look something like the formula `pmp-resource-index = spmp-index + pmpimp`.
Another approach is the non-zero-start mapping.
As an example, `PMPResource[32]` to `PMPResource[63]` could be mapped to `SPMP[32]` to `SPMP[63]`, while `SPMP[0]` to `SPMP[31]` are not implemented.
In this scenario, the SPMP CSR index mirrors that of the `PMPResources` (when it doesn't exceed 64).
A potential drawback is that software must be able to handle scenarios where SPMP doesn't begin at the lowest CSR number.
Nevertheless, this is generally acceptable since S-mode software commonly inspects the available SPMP entries by enumerating CSRs at boot time and utilizes the SPMP CSR accordingly based on this probe.
Additionally, this design choice becomes even more rational when the Sscsrind extension is implemented and in use.
PMP Resouce Sharing extension now supports both mapping methods (and others), and the software only needs to check the usable SPMP entries before using them.
