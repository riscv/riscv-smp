== S-mode Physical Memory Protection (SPMP)

An optional RISC-V S-mode Physical Memory Protection (SPMP) provides per-hart supervisor-mode control registers to allow physical memory access privileges (read, write, execute) to be specified for each physical memory region.
// The SPMP is also applied to data accesses in M-mode when the MPRV bit in mstatus is set and the MPP field in mstatus contains S or U.

// Like PMP, the granularity of SPMP access control settings is platform-specific and, within a platform, may vary by physical memory region. However, the standard SPMP encoding support regions as small as four bytes. 

If PMP/ePMP is implemented, accesses succeed only if both PMP/ePMP and SPMP permission checks pass.
The implementation can perform SPMP checks in parallel with PMA and PMP.
The SPMP exception reports have higher priority than PMP or PMA exceptions (e.g., an SPMP exception will be raised if the access violates both SPMP and PMP, as will the PMP exception).

SPMP checks will be applied to all accesses whose effective privilege mode is S or U, including instruction fetches and data accesses in S and U mode, 
and data accesses in M-mode when the MPRV bit in mstatus is set and the MPP field in mstatus contains S or U.

SPMP registers can always be modified by M-mode and S-mode software. 
SPMP can grant permissions to U-mode, which has none by default. 
SPMP can also revoke permissions from S-mode.

=== Requirements

1) S mode should be implemented

2) ``sstatus.SUM`` should be WARL.

3) ``sstatus.MXR`` should be WARL.


[NOTE]
====
1. The SPMP uses the sstatus.SUM (permit Supervisor User Memory access) bit to modify the privilege with which S-mode loads and stores access to physical memory, sstatus.SUM should be WARL and the semantics of sstatus.SUM in SPMP is consistent with those in Sv.

2. To better support M-mode emulation handler (e.g., the emulation handler needs to read instructions with MXR=1 MPRV=1), sstatus.MXR (Make eXecutable Readable) should be WARL and the semantics of MXR in SPMP is consistent with those in Sv.
====

=== S-mode Physical Memory Protection CSRs

Like PMP, SPMP entries are described by an 8-bit configuration register and one XLEN-bit address register. Some SPMP settings additionally use the address register associated with the preceding SPMP entry. 

The SPMP configuration registers are packed into CSRs the same way as PMP. For RV32, 16 CSRs, spmpcfg0-spmpcfg15, hold the configurations spmp0cfg-spmp63cfg for the 64 SPMP entries.
For RV64, even numbered CSRs (i.e., spmpcfg0, spmpcfg2, ..., spmpcfg14) hold the configurations for the 64 SPMP entries; odd numbered CSRs (e.g., spmpcfg1) are illegal.
<<RV32_cfg>> and <<RV64_cfg>> demonstrate the first 16 entries of SPMP. The layout of the rest entries is similar.

[NOTE]
====
The terms, entry and rule, are similar to ePMP.

The implementation should decode all SPMP CSRs, and it can modify the number of *writable SPMP entries* while the remaining SPMP CSRs are read-only zero.

The lowest-numbered SPMP entries must be implemented first.

The SPMP address registers are CSRs named spmpaddr0-spmpaddr63.
Each SPMP address register encodes bits 33-2 of 34-bit physical address for RV32, as shown in <<spmpcfg-rv32>>.
For RV64, each SPMP address encodes bits 55-2 of a 56-bit physical address, as shown in <<spmpcfg-rv64>>.
Fewer address bits may be implemented for specific reasons, e.g., systems with smaller physical address space.
The number of address bits should be the same for all *writable SPMP entries*.
Implemented address bits must extend to the LSB format, except as otherwise permitted by granularity rules in "Address Matching" subsection of PMP.

The layout of SPMP configuration registers is the same as PMP configuration registers, as shown in <<spmpcfg>>. The register is WARL.
The rules and encodings for permission are explained in section 2.4, which resembles the encoding of ePMP (except SPMP does not use locked rules).

. The S bit marks a rule as *S-mode-only* when set and *U-mode-only* when unset.

. Bit 5 and 6 are reserved for future use.

. The A field will be described in the following sections (2.3).

. The R/W/X bits control read, write, and instruction execution permissions.

=== Address Matching

The A field in an SPMP entry's configuration register encodes the address-matching mode of the associated SPMP address register.
It is the same as PMP/ePMP.

Please refer to the "Address Matching" subsection of PMP in the riscv-privileged spec for detailed information.


[NOTE]
====
Software may determine the SPMP granularity by writing zero to spmp0cfg, then writing all ones to spmpaddr0, then reading back spmpaddr0. If G is the index of the least-significant bit set, the SPMP granularity is 2 G+2 bytes.
====


=== Encoding of Permissions


SPMP has three kinds of rules: *S-mode-only*, *U-mode-only* and *Shared-Region* rules.
// The S bit marks a rule as *S-mode-only* when set and *U-mode-only* when unset.
// The encoding ``spmpcfg.RW=01`` encodes a Shared-Region and ``spmpcfg.SRWX=1000`` is reserved for future standard use.

. An *S-mode-only* rule is *enforced* on Supervisor mode and *denied* on User mode.
+
. A *U-mode-only* rule is *enforced* on User modes and *denied*/*enforced* on Supervisor mode depending on the value of ``sstatus.SUM`` bit:
+
* If ``sstatus.SUM`` is set, a U-mode-only rule is enforced without code execution permission on Supervisor mode to ensure supervisor mode execution protection.
+
* If ``sstatus.SUM`` is unset, a U-mode-only rule is denied on Supervisor mode.
+
. A *Shared-Region* rule is enforced on both Supervisor and User modes, with restrictions depending on the ``spmpcfg.S`` and ``spmpcfg.X`` bits:
+
* If ``spmpcfg.S`` is not set, the region can be used for sharing data between S-mode and U-mode, yet not executable. S-mode has RW permission to that region, and U-mode has read-only permission if ``spmpcfg.X`` is not set or RW permission if ``spmpcfg.X`` is set.
+
* If ``spmpcfg.S`` is set, the region can be used for sharing code between S-mode and U-mode, yet not writeable. S-mode and U-mode have execute permission to the region, and S-mode may also have read permission if ``spmpcfg.X`` is set.
+
// * The encoding ``spmpcfg.SRWX=1111`` can be used for sharing data between S-mode and U-mode, where both modes only have read-only permission to the region.
* The encoding ``spmpcfg.SRWX=1111`` is used for backward compatibility, where both S-mode and U-mode have RWX permissions.
+
. The encoding ``spmpcfg.SRWX=1000`` is reserved for future standard use.

The encoding and results are shown in the <<spmpencode>>:

[[spmpencode]]
image::SPMP_Encoding_Table_v3.svg[title="SPMP Encoding Table"]
// .SPMP Encoding Table.
// include::images/bytefield/spmpencode.adoc[]

**Allow**: Access succeeds.

**Deny**: Access fails.

**Enforce**: The R/W/X permissions are enforced on accesses.

**EnforceNoX**: The R/W permissions are enforced on accesses, while the X bit is forced to be zero.

**SHR**: It is shared between S/U modes with X, RX, RW, or ReadOnly privileges.

**RSVD**: It is reserved for future use.

**SUM bit**: The SPMP uses the sstatus.SUM (permit Supervisor User Memory access) bit to modify the privilege with which S-mode loads and stores access to physical memory. The semantics of sstatus.SUM in SPMP is consistent with those in Sv.



=== Priority and Matching Logic
Like PMP entries, SPMP entries are also statically prioritized. The lowest-numbered SPMP entry that matches any byte of access (indicated by an address and the accessed length) determines whether that access is allowed or fails. The SPMP entry must match all bytes of access, or the access fails, irrespective of the S, R, W, and X bits.

On some implementations, misaligned loads, stores, and instruction fetches may also be decomposed into multiple accesses, some of which may succeed before an exception occurs. 
In particular, a portion of a misaligned store that passes the SPMP check may become visible, even if another portion fails the SPMP check. 
The same behavior may manifest for stores wider than XLEN bits (e.g., the FSD instruction in RV32D), even when the store address is naturally aligned.

1. If the effective privilege mode of the access is M, the access is ``allowed``;
2. If the effective privilege mode of the access is S and no SPMP entry matches, the access is ``allowed``;
3. If the effective privilege mode of the access is U and no SPMP entry matches, but at least one SPMP entry is implemented, the access is ``denied``;
4. Otherwise, the access is checked according to the permission bits in the matching SPMP entry. It is allowed if it satisfies the permission checking with the SRWX encoding corresponding to the access type.

=== SPMP and Paging
The table below shows which mechanism to use. (Assume both paged virtual memory and SPMP are implemented.)

[cols="^1,^1", stripes=even, options="header"]
|===
|satp|Isolation mechanism
|satp.mode == Bare|SPMP only
|satp.mode != Bare|Paged Virtual Memory only
|===

We do not allow both SPMP and paged virtual memory permissions to be actived at the same time now because:
(1) It will introduce one more layer to check permission for each memory access. This issue will be more serious for a guest OS that may have host SPMP and guest SPMP.
(2) Paged virtual memory can provide sufficient protection.

That means SPMP is enabled when `satp.mode==Bare` and SPMP is implemented.


[NOTE]
====
Please refer to Table "Encoding of satp MODE field" in the riscv-privileged spec for detailed information on the satp.MODE field.

If page-based virtual memory is implemented, an SFENCE.VMA instruction with rs1=x0 and rs2=x0 is needed after the SPMP CSRs are written.
If page-based virtual memory is not implemented, memory accesses check the SPMP settings synchronously, so no fence is needed.
Please refer to hypervisor extension for additional synchronization requirements when hypervisor is implemented.
====

=== Exceptions
Failed accesses generate an exception. SPMP follows the strategy that uses different exception codes for different cases, i.e., load, store/AMO, instruction faults for memory load, memory store/AMO and instruction fetch, respectively.

The SPMP reuses exception codes of page fault for SPMP fault.
Because page fault is typically delegated to S-mode, so does SPMP fault, we can benefit from reusing page fault.
S-mode software(i.e., OS) can distinguish page fault from SPMP fault by checking satp.mode (as mentioned in 2.6, SPMP and paged virtual memory will not be activated simultaneously).
*SPMP proposes to rename page fault to SPMP/page fault for clarity*.

Note that a single instruction may generate multiple accesses, which may not be mutually atomic. 

Table of renamed exception codes:

[cols="^1,^1,^1", stripes=even, options="header"]
|===
|Interrupt|Exception Code|Description
|0|12|Instruction SPMP/page fault
|0|13|Load SPMP/page fault
|0|15|Store/AMO SPMP/page fault
|===

[NOTE]
====
Please refer to Table "Supervisor cause register (scause) values after trap" in the riscv-privileged spec for detailed information on exception codes.
====

*Delegation*: Unlike PMP, which uses access faults for violations, SPMP uses SPMP/page faults for violations. The benefit of using SPMP/page faults is that we can delegate the violations caused by SPMP to S-mode, while the access violations caused by PMP can still be handled by machine mode.



=== Context Switching Optimization
With SPMP, each context switch requires the OS to store 64 address registers and 8 configuration registers (RV64), which is costly and unnecessary.
So the SPMP proposes an optimization to minimize the overhead caused by context switching.

We add two CSRs called *_spmpswitch0_* and *_spmpswitch1_*, which are XLEN-bit read/write registers, as shown in <<spmpswitch-rv32>>.
For RV64, only *_spmpswitch0_* is used, as shown in <<spmpswitch-rv64>>.
Each bit of this register holds the on/off status of the corresponding SPMP entry.
During the context switch, the OS can store and restore spmpswitch as part of the context.
An SPMP entry is activated only when both corresponding bits in spmpswitch and A field of spmp[i]cfg are set. (i.e., spmpswitch[i] & spmp[i]cfg.A!=0)

[NOTE]
====
If the `spmpswitch` is implemented, and `spmpcfg[i].A == TOR`, the entry matches any address y such that spmpaddr[i-1] ≤ y < spmpaddr[i] (irrespective of values of spmpcfg[i-1] and spmpswitch[i-1]).

// If `spmpcfg[0].A == TOR`, zero is used for the lower bound, and so it matches any address y < spmpaddr[0].

*The reset state*: On system reset, the `spmpswitch` registers should be zero.
====


=== Access Methods of SPMP CSRs
How SPMP CSRs are accessed depends on whether the `Sscsrind` extension is implemented or not.

*Indirect CSR access*: The SPMP supports indirect CSR access if the `Sscsrind` extension is implemented.
The `Sscsrind` defines 1 select CSR (`siselect`) and 6 alias CSRs (`sireg[i]`).
Each combination of `siselect` and `sireg[i]` represents an access to the corresponding SPMP CSR.

[cols="^1,^2",stripes=even, options="header"]
|===
|siselect number|indirect CSR access of sireg[i]
|siselect#1|sireg[1-6] -> spmpcfg[0-5]
|siselect#2|sireg[1-6] -> spmpcfg[6-11]
|siselect#3|sireg[1-4] -> spmpcfg[12-15]
|siselect#4|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[0-5]
|siselect#5|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[6-11]
|siselect#6|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[12-17]
|siselect#7|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[18-23]
|siselect#8|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[24-29]
|siselect#9|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[30-35]
|siselect#10|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[36-41]
|siselect#11|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[42-47]
|siselect#12|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[48-53]
|siselect#13|sireg[1-6] -> spmpaddr[54-59]
|siselect#14|sireg[1-4] -> spmpaddr[60-63]
|siselect#15|sireg[1-2] -> spmpswitch[0-1]
|===

*Direct CSR access*: SPMP CSRs can be accessed directly with corresponding CSR numbers if the `Sscsrind` extension is not implemented.

[NOTE]
====
The specific value of `siselect#1-15` will be allocated after review by the Arch Review Committee.

Please refers to the specification of the `Sscsrind` extension for details of indirect CSR access.
